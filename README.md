## About

This project aims to make a version control system and make it usable
proving that creating any "complex" piece of software can be done
by just dedicating time each day, starting from most
difficult tasks...

### How to use it

In Windows execute the `install.bat` file.

In Linux/MacOS just run the

```shell
make
```

Command.
